## Introduction 
The goal of this project is to make a forum. A forums consists of creating your own posts, liking other posts or comment on them. Before publishing your post, you can add an image or a tag if you feel like any of the pre-existing tags corresponds. You will be able to view your liked posts or your own posts in a certain page to separate them from all other posts. An authentification system is mandatory and has to be implemented for the forum to work so you will be able to create your own account on the forum.

## Role in the project
This is a group project between 4 people. My part can be seen inside **assets/js/publicationForm**, **assets/js/register.js** and **template/publicationFormTemplate.html**. The code inside **code/publications/databasePublication.go** and **code/publications/handlersPublication.go** is also mine, however, there are some parts that have been modified by another member of the project. This is due to the fact that my functions have been made before the system of likes and comments has been added. Some of the functions inside those files have been modified to meet those requirements. I did not create any content that includes references to comments, likes, upvotes, or downvotes. Therefore, any code containing these elements in those files is not a result of my contribution to the project. This can also be said for any **struct**.

## About
â€¢ The images for the upvotes are not stored within the project files, they are taken from an external website, and thus, if the images become unavailable for whatever reason, they will not be shown anymore.
